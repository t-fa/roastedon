      <h3>Why Roasted On?</h3>
      <h4>We believe in the freshest coffee</h4>
      <p>
        Ordinary grocery store coffee comes with a "Best By" date, which is
        usually an arbitrary date. Often the "Best By" date is months after the
        coffee is roasted. Many coffee enthusiasts would consider such coffee to
        have gone bad. While the beans aren't expired in the traditional sense,
        they're past the point where they offer the freshest possible flavor.
        Roasters who use a "Roasted On" date believe in fresh coffee. A "Roasted
        On" date tells you exactly the day the coffee was roasted and allows you
        to enjoy the best possible cup.

      <h4>Do I need to be a homebrewer to use this site?</h4>
      <p>
        No! Coffee shops that sell coffee with a "Roasted On" date believe in
        high quality coffee. If you're just stopping in for a coffee, you're
        likely to enjoy a great cup.
